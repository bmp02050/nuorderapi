# NuOrder Api

The class library will contain every current model of the data available in NuOrder's documentation located here: https://nuorderapi1.docs.apiary.io/ 

The Services will have each call for each model type as well as the "WebService" class provided by the documentation from NuOrder.  

I figured there are at least a few other people in the world who are using the API provided by NuOrder instead of the FTP flat file management who would benefit from this.  

As a note, I've been told that there aren't enough requests from users to make sure the NuOrder API has continuous development.

Known Bugs:
  NuOrder's API DOES NOT SUPPORT Buyer creation.  That must be done in the web UI from NuOrder's site.
